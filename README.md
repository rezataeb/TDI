# Speech Popularity Model

<br> 

### Main Goal 

In this project, I am trying to predict the number of views of TED Talks on its online platform based on some features - mainly transcript of the talk and areas of the talk (tags).

### Users

The possible audience of this project can be anyone who wants to give a talk in different realms and topics. Possible users can revise contents of their talks (transcripts) based on the outputs of the future web application. For now, users can benefit from some suggestions which will be mentioned at the end of this notebook. 

### Dataset 

The original dataset is captured from https://data.world/owentemple/ted-talks-complete-list 

This dataset contains all uploaded TED Talks on its platform (2475 talks each with 123 attributes) till June 2017. Some of the features are: Speaker name, Headline, URL, Transcript, Month filmed, Year filmed, Event, Duration, Date published, View as of June 2017, Tags, and etc.
